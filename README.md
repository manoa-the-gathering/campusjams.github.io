# What is Manoa: The Gathering?

Manoa: The Gathering is a free, fun, and functional online simulator of the trading card game Magic: The Gathering. But wait, it gets better! As the name implies, MtG (Manoa: The Gathering) is unique from Magic as it focuses on the lore and monuments of the University of Hawaii at Manoa.

## Current site
Temporarily hosted on heroku. Still in testing phase. Accounts by request.

## Okay, what do I need to know to play MtG?

First and foremost, you'll need a University of Hawaii account to sign in and play, so if you don't attend or work at UH, then sorry, this isn't the app for you. In order to use our soon-to-be super awesome app, you need an internet browser (preferably a Chromium-based one), a strong internet connection, and knowledge of how to play Magic: The Gathering. MtG doesn't have a system to check the rules, as it is entirely based on the players' actions in what they choose to do. You can break the rules and play your entire hand on the first turn, but your opponent will most likely report you and you will be banned. So don't do that please.

## Guided Tour

If you see the above screen, that means you've clicked on the link above and you are now on Manoa: The Gathering. Congratulations!

The footer at the bottom is how you'll navigate our site.
<br>

**Chat Page**

<br>
<br>
Now you're in our _chat_ page! You can interact with other online users (listed on the right) by typing your messages into the text box below the chat. If you click on an online user, it replaces the chat with a DM between the two of you. If you want to go back to the general chat, click on the button labeled _General Chat_. **Awesome chat cheat: type "_rainbows_" without the quotes and be amazed!** If you're super lame and don't like it, type in "_no rainbows_".
<br>
<br>
Once you're done chatting and making friends, you can start playing a game with someone else. If you click on someone's username and click on the button labeled _Match Request_, it sends them a match request. You'll notice messages appearing in the box below the chat. Once it tells you that the requested person has accepted the match request, click on _Accept_ and you'll get into the game. On the other hand, if someone sends you a match request, you can click on their name and then the _Accept_ button to accept their request.
<br>
<br>
**Battle Page**

<br>
Sample duel in action. Click cards to interact with them. (tap, untap, sacrifice, attack, block, etc.)
<br>
There is another chat box within the battle page for you to communicate with your opponent to help resolve complex card effects. Add/Subtract your own lifepoints accordingly. OGY to view your opponent's graveyard. GY to view yours and also exile cards for effects.

**About Page**

<br>
<br>
Once you're done reading about how awesome, our app is, head on over to the _tutorial_ page, so you can get a quick refresher on how MtG plays, and so you don't accidentally break our rules and get banned.
<br>
<br>
**Rules Page**
![Rules Page](/screenshots/rules.png)
<br>
<br>
When you first arrive at the tutorial page, there will be a list of links you can click to access the specific rules. The first, and most important, one is our _Code of Conduct_ (pictured above). This details the rules of our app, so read carefully.
<br>
<br>
Alright, let's get back to our _home_ page. If you click on the _Play now_ button, you'll be prompted to sign in using your UH account. Upon doing so, you'll notice that the _Play now_ button has changed to _Find a Match_. This is what you'll want to press if you actually want to use our app.
