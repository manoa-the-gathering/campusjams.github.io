  "body": "# What is Manoa: The Gathering?\r\n\r\nManoa: The Gathering is a free, fun, and functional online simulator of the trading card game Magic: The Gathering. But wait, it gets better! As the name implies, MtG (Manoa: The Gathering) is unique from Magic as it focuses on the lore and monuments of the University of Hawaii at Manoa.\r\n\r\n## Current site\r\n\r\n[Click here](https://manoathegathering.meteorapp.com/) to play! Unfortunately, we don't have the entire app built out yet, but don't worry, we will soon.\r\n\r\n## Okay, what do I need to know to play MtG?\r\n\r\nIn order to use our soon-to-be super awesome app, you need an internet browser (preferably a Chromium-based one), a strong internet connection, and knowledge of how to play Magic: The Gathering. MtG won't have a system to check the rules, as it will be entirely based on the players' actions in what they choose to do. You can break the rules and play your entire hand on the first turn, but your opponent will most likely report you and you will be banned. So don't do that please.\r\n\r\n## User Guide\r\n\r\nIn order to use our app, you must have a UH account. You click on the large \"_Play now_\" button to log in with your account, and then the button changes to \"_Find a match_\". Clicking on that leads to our match page, in which you can see and chat with other online users. We don't have the actual game implemented yet, but for now, you can trash talk your future opponents!\r\n\r\nClicking the buttons on the bottom lead you to their respective pages. For example, \"_about_\" leads to the page that talks about our app. Also, after logging in, the \"_logout_\" button appears in the footer, so you use that to log out. However, due to the functionality of the UH CAS authentication, you must clear your cookies if you don't want your next \"Play now\" click to automatically log you in.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n\r\n**Here are some current screenshots of our app**\r\n\r\n#### Landing Page (day version)\r\n![Landing page](/screenshots/landingpage.png)\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n#### Landing Page (night version)\r\n![Landing page night](/screenshots/landingpagev2.png)\r\n<br>\r\n#### About Page\r\n![About page](/screenshots/aboutpage.png)\r\n<br>\r\n#### Match & Chat Page\r\n![Match Page](/screenshots/matchpage.png)\r\n\r\n## Developer Guide\r\n\r\nIf you are a developer that would like to modify our app, you can click on the above button leading to our GitHub repo and clone it. The `master` branch is what is currently deployed to Galaxy. Our `kadira` branch is like our testing branch, in which we test functionalities before merging to `master`. The other branches are pretty self-explanatory, and our app follows the recent ES6 Meteor app structure.\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to make changes, do what you want and then submit a pull request. We'll look it over and either merge it, or let you know about what should be changed!\r\n\r\n## Contributors\r\n\r\n[Irene Fang](https://irene-f.github.io/), [Creighton Chan](https://creightonchan.github.io/), [John Headland](https://jheadland.github.io/), [Lexa Mink-Flacco](https://acvmf.github.io/)\r\n\r\n## Milestones\r\n\r\n[Milestone 1](https://github.com/manoa-the-gathering/ManoaTheGathering/projects/1)\r\n\r\n[Milestone 2](https://github.com/manoa-the-gathering/ManoaTheGathering/projects/2)\r\n\r\n[Milestone 3](https://github.com/manoa-the-gathering/ManoaTheGathering/projects/3)\r\n",
