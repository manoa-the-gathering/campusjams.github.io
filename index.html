<p>Manoa: The Gathering is a free, fun, and functional online simulator of the trading card game Magic: The Gathering. But wait, it gets better! As the name implies, MtG (Manoa: The Gathering) is unique from Magic as it focuses on the lore and monuments of the University of Hawaii at Manoa.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we don't have the app built out yet, but don't worry, we will!</p>

<p>In order to use our soon-to-be super awesome app, you need an internet browser (preferably a Chromium-based one), a strong internet connection, and knowledge of how to play Magic: The Gathering. MtG won't have a system to check the rules, as it will be entirely based on the players' actions in what they choose to do. You can break the rules and play your entire hand on the first turn, but your opponent will most likely report you and you will be banned. So don't do that please.</p>
