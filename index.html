<br>
The footer at the bottom is how you'll navigate our site. First and foremost, let's look at the <em>about</em> page so you know what we're all about.
<br>
<br>
<strong>About Page</strong>
<img src="/screenshots/about.png" alt="About Page">
<br>
<br>
Once you're done reading about how awesome, our app is, head on over to the <em>tutorial</em> page, so you can get a quick refresher on how MtG plays, and so you don't accidentally break our rules and get banned.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Rules Page</strong>
<img src="/screenshots/rules.png" alt="Rules Page">
<br>
<br>
When you first arrive at the tutorial page, there will be a list of links you can click to access the specific rules. The first, and most important, one is our <em>Code of Conduct</em> (pictured above). This details the rules of our app, so read carefully.
<br>
<br>
Alright, let's get back to our <em>home</em> page. If you click on the <em>Play now</em> button, you'll be prompted to sign in using your UH account. Upon doing so, you'll notice that the <em>Play now</em> button has changed to <em>Find a Match</em>. This is what you'll want to press if you actually want to use our app.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Chat Page</strong>
<img src="/screenshots/chatroom.png" alt="Chat Page">
<br>
<br>
Now you're in our <em>chat</em> page! You can interact with other online users (listed on the right) by typing your messages into the text box below the chat. If you click on an online user, it replaces the chat with a DM between the two of you. If you want to go back to the general chat, click on the button labeled <em>General Chat</em>. <strong>Awesome chat cheat: type "<em>rainbows</em>" without the quotes and be amazed!</strong> If you're super lame and don't like it, type in "<em>no rainbows</em>".
<br>
<br>
Once you're done chatting and making friends, you can start playing a game with someone else. If you click on someone's username and click on the button labeled <em>Match Request</em>, it sends them a match request. You'll notice messages appearing in the box below the chat. Once it tells you that the requested person has accepted the match request, click on <em>Accept</em> and you'll get into the game. On the other hand, if someone sends you a match request, you can click on their name and then the <em>Accept</em> button to accept their request.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Battle Page</strong>
<img src="/screenshots/draw.png" alt="Battle Page">
<br>
<br>
Now that you're in the battle page, you'll see in the chat box who was randomly assigned to go first. That person can draw and play their turn through the steps of Magic (detailed in the tutorial page).
<br>

  Click cards to interact with them.
