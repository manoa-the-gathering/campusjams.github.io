<p>Manoa: The Gathering is a free, fun, and functional online simulator of the trading card game Magic: The Gathering. But wait, it gets better! As the name implies, MtG (Manoa: The Gathering) is unique from Magic as it focuses on the lore and monuments of the University of Hawaii at Manoa.</p>

<p>First and foremost, you'll need a University of Hawaii account to sign in and play, so if you don't attend or work at UH, then sorry, this isn't the app for you. In order to use our soon-to-be super awesome app, you need an internet browser (preferably a Chromium-based one), a strong internet connection, and knowledge of how to play Magic: The Gathering. MtG doesn't have a system to check the rules, as it is entirely based on the players' actions in what they choose to do. You can break the rules and play your entire hand on the first turn, but your opponent will most likely report you and you will be banned. So don't do that please.</p>

<strong>Landing Page</strong>
<img src="/screenshots/landing.png" alt="Landing Page">
<br>
<br>
The footer at the bottom is how you'll navigate our site. First and foremost, let's look at the <em>about</em> page so you know what we're all about.
<br>
<br>
<strong>About Page</strong>
<img src="/screenshots/about.png" alt="About Page">
<br>
<br>
Once you're done reading about how awesome, our app is, head on over to the <em>tutorial</em> page, so you can get a quick refresher on how MtG plays, and so you don't accidentally break our rules and get banned.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Rules Page</strong>
<img src="/screenshots/rules.png" alt="Rules Page">
<br>
<br>
When you first arrive at the tutorial page, there will be a list of links you can click to access the specific rules. The first, and most important, one is our <em>Code of Conduct</em> (pictured above). This details the rules of our app, so read carefully.
<br>
<br>
Alright, let's get back to our <em>home</em> page. If you click on the <em>Play now</em> button, you'll be prompted to sign in using your UH account. Upon doing so, you'll notice that the <em>Play now</em> button has changed to <em>Find a Match</em>. This is what you'll want to press if you actually want to use our app.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Chat Page</strong>
<img src="/screenshots/chat.png" alt="Chat Page">
<br>
<br>
Now you're in our <em>chat</em> page! You can interact with other online users (listed on the right) by typing your messages into the text box below the chat. If you click on an online user, it replaces the chat with a DM between the two of you. If you want to go back to the general chat, click on the button labeled <em>General Chat</em>.
<br>
<br>
Once you're done chatting and making friends, you can start playing a game with someone else. If you click on someone's username and click on the button labeled <em>Match Request</em>, it sends them a match request. You'll notice messages appearing in the box below the chat. Once it tells you that the requested person has accepted the match request, click on <em>Accept</em> and you'll get into the game. On the other hand, if someone sends you a match request, you can click on their name and then the <em>Accept</em> button to accept their request.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Battle Page</strong>
<img src="/screenshots/battle.png" alt="Battle Page">
<br>
<br>
Now that you're in the battle page, you'll see in the chat box who was randomly assigned to go first. That person can draw and play their turn through the steps of Magic (detailed in the tutorial page). There is another chat box within the battle page for you to communicate with your opponent, and buttons that are intuitively labeled with what they do. For instance, <em>Draw</em> has you draw a card from your deck. On the left, you'll see the Life Points of both players and you can add or subtract from the LP. 
<br>
<br>
Note that when you're playing, it tells you who is on the green side and who is on the blue side. Please only play and interact with the cards on your proper side, or that will be a violation of our rules. Furthermore, your initial hand will be laid face-down. Clicking on the cards in your hand will flip them face-up to be seen only by you.
<br>
<br>
Have fun!</p>

<p>If you are a developer that would like to modify our app, you can click on the above button leading to our GitHub repo and clone it. The <code>master</code> branch is what is currently deployed to Galaxy. Our <code>kadira</code> branch is like our testing branch, in which we test functionalities before merging to <code>master</code>. The other branches are pretty self-explanatory, and our app follows the recent ES6 Meteor app structure.</p>

<p>If you'd like to make changes, do what you want and then submit a pull request. We'll look it over and either merge it, or let you know about what should be changed!</p>
